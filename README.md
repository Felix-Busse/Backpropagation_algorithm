# Backpropagation_neuronal_network_class
 Providing a neuronal network class by programming explicitly forward and backpropagation algorithm
 
 Class object is capable of being trained with training data. This will use the programmed forward and backpropagation algorithm.
 As an example the reproduction of a simple image can be learned in the notebook.
