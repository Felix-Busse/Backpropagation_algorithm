# Backpropagation_algorithm
 A neuronal network class with explicit programmed forward and backpropagation algorithm

 ### How to
 Clone this repository and instantiate a object of the neuronal network class provided in [Jupyter-Notebook](net_object_orientated.ipynb).

### Description
 The class allows definition of sequential dense neuronal networks. Simple gradient descent training of neuronal network can be demonstrated by using the explicit programmed backpropagation algorithm, see example in the notebook.
